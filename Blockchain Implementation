Assignment #4
Total Points: 100
Below is a simple implementation of a blockchain called PandasChain. This blockchain stores transactions in 
pandas DataFrames (in-memory) and does not write to disk. The following are the components of this chain:
1. Transaction - A transaction is an exchange of Pandas coins between two parties. In the case of our blockchain, a transaction 
consists of:
    - Sender: The name of the party that is sending i.e. "Bob"
    
    - Receiver: The name of the party that is receiving i.e. "Alice"
    
    - Value: The float amount of Pandas Coins transferred
    
    - Timestamp: The datetime the transaction occured
    
    - Transaction Hash: A SHA-256 hash of the string concatenation of timestamp, sender, receiver and value
2. Block - A block holds a pool of transactions in a DataFrame. The maximum a single block can hold is 10 transactions. 
When a block is created, it contains zero transactions and has a status of UNCOMITTED. Once a block contains 10 transactions, 
that block then is marked COMMITTED and a new block is created for future transactions. Blocks are chained together by 
their block hash ID and previous block hash. Each block, except the first genesis block, tracks the hash of the previous block. 
When a block generates its own hash identifier, it uses the previous blocks hash as one of several strings it will concantenate. 
A block consists of:
    - Sequence ID: A unique sequential number starting at 0 that increments by 1 that identifies each block
    
    - Transactions list: A pandas DataFrame containing all of the transactions contained by the block
    
    - Status: Either UNCOMMITTED or COMMITTED
    
    - Merkle Root: A root hash of transactions. In real blockchains like Bitcoin & Ethereum, a 
    Merkle trie (yes, that's spelled trie!) uses a binary tree. We won't do that here. In our case, we will not use 
    a tree but simply take the hash of the string concatenation of all the transaction hashes 
    in a block once a block is full (reaches 10 transactions)
    
    - Block hash: The hash of this block is created by the hash of the string concatenation of the previous block's 
    hash, the chains hash id, current date time, sequence id of the block and the root Merkle hash. 
    The block hash is generated when a block is full and is committed.
3. PandasChain - A container class that manages all interaction to the internal state of the chain, i.e. users only 
interact with an instance of PandasChain and no other class. A PandasChain class consists of:
    - Name: An arbitrary name of this instance of the chain provided in the constructor when PandasChain is created (see
    test cases for usage examples)
    
    - Chain: A Python list of blocks
    
    - Chain ID: A hash concatenation of a UUID, name of the chain, timestamp of creation of the chain that uniquely
    identifies this chain instance.
    
    - Sequence ID: Tracks the current sequence ID and manages it for new blocks to grab and use
    
    - Previous Hash: Tracks what the previous hash of the just committed block is so that a new block can be instantiated 
    with the previous hash passed into its constructor
    
    - Current block: Which block is current and available to hold incoming transactions
    The only way to interact with a PandasChain instance is via the add_transaction() method that accepts new transactions and 
    methods that print out chain data like display_block_headers(). There should be no other way to reach the underlying
    blocks or pandas DataFrames that hold transactions.

To Do
-------------
One way to tackle this assigment is to start with these classes blank and slowly build it out in a separate file so that as
you build it out it continues to run without errors, allowing you to incrementally build and test. There is a parent/child
one-to-many relationship between PandasChain, Blocks and the transactions a block holds. PandasChain is parent to
one or more blocks and manages the lifecycle of those blocks. Blocks manage transactions.
To break this into manageable chunks, in an isolated environment create a pandas table with the columns listed below in the
code and make sure you how to append rows to it. Then wrap it in a Block class and make the Block class work. Then build out the
PandasChain class.
Exercise #1. Complete the code below to produce a working PandasChain. Hints are provided wherever feasible.
Exercise #2. Using PandasChain's get_values(), get all of the transaction values across all blocks in the chain 
and plot them. Use an incrementing sequential number for x and the transaction values for y.
Extra Credit (+10 points): Have get_values() return the timestamp for each value transacted and plot a timeseries as well.
